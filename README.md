# react-flux-bootstrap

This is a repository for bootstrapping a new react-flux project.
Many valuable information is gathered through community blogs and suggestions.

Hopefully, this repository will be a very good example or maybe even a legitimate bootstrap project
for people looking to start a new flux project.
